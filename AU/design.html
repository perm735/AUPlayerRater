<h1>Player Rater</h1>
Program for rating players and determining a price value based on statistics and salary cap.  

Future considerations include:
<li>Player trends
<li>Age considerations
<li>...

<h2>Why Java?</h2>
The application will be launched as a Swing based Applet from a browser.  Java uses a platform based JRE to interpret common bytecode.  This allows my application to run on any platform and makes it highly portable.

<h2>Data Source</h2>
One of the hardest things for this kind of application is a data source.  Baseball uses statistics to determine the value of a player.  These statistics are used in fantasy baseball to determine a players value or rating.  I will use the CSV files provided by CBS Sportsline to generate the data used to determine a players rating.

<h2>Milestones</h2>
Outline of milestones in anticipation of a release.
<h3>Base rating functionality</h3>
<b>Requirements</b>
The first milestone should provide the ability to import data, sort data, provide ratings, and display results.  The first milestone will not include a substantial graphics component and will use command line arguements for determining sort type, value, and other information.

Data source: This release will use CSV files that are located in a known location.

<h3>Applet packaging</h3>
<b>Requirements</b>
The second milestone should allow the application to launch itself from a browser and output the results.

Data source: Known location, static data.

<h2>Design</h2>
This section will outline how the application will provide the following requirements:
